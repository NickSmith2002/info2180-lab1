 <h2>Nicholas Smith</h2>
 <p>I'm Nicholas Smith, a third-year computer science student who changed his major from biochemistry when he first enrolled in college. I enjoy listening to Lana Del Rey and watching movies.
 Because Web Development is the area of computing that interests me the most, I'm taking this course. I've always been curious with how websites are organized, and in third form, I used to work independently on Tumblr. I want to use this course as a chance to learn more and significantly advance in this field.</p>
